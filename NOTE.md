This program generates a merit list which contains information of ranging from name to their minority status. I tried to mention all the minute information which MHT-CET mentions it its merit list.
In order to generate the merit list I have used Structure concept.
The program gives best output when CodeBlocks is used and Code Editor and Terminal and Console.
